# AHA - Arch Hyprland Ansible

A simple intallation of Hyprland with my Dotfiles into Arch Linux and automated by ansible.

My Dotfiles are here: https://github.com/odevsa/dotfiles

## Disclaimer

This is for my personal use and it's working in progress, so files can be deleted, things can break, etc. If you want to try it, it`s for your own risk.

## Important

It's in progress, so please EXECUTE ONLY ONCE.

It's needing of some check before to do changes in files of the system yet, so if you execute more then one time, the changes will be duplicated in files.

## What you will need

- Any distribution based on Arch Linux, preferably a clean installation of Arch Linux with systemd-boot (grub not tested yet).
- Internet connection:

  - Ethernet
  - Wifi with `iwctl`

    ```
    $ iwctl

    [iwctl]# station <DEVICE> connect "<SSID>"
    ```

  - Wifi with `NetworkManager`
    ```
    $ nmcli device wifi connect "<SSID>" --ask
    ```

## Automatic Install

Just run this code and see the magic

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odevsa/aha/main/install.sh)"
```

You may want to use flags to customize installation

| Flag          | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--no-amdgpu` | Disables the installation of AMD GPU (amdgpu).                                                    |
| `--no-nvidia` | Disables the installation of NVIDIA GPU (nvidia).                                                 |
| `--no-gpu`    | Disables the installation of both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.                                            |
| `--no-apps`   | Disables all application-related installations.                                                   |
| `--only-core` | Installs only core system components, disabling other features like applications and GPU drivers. |

For example: If you don't want Nvidia driver and default applications, you can try:

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odevsa/aha/main/install.sh)" -- --no-nvidia --no-apps
```
